## Navigation on the Web

New navigation experience when you publish. To the left is a nav and filter bar that allow you to navigate through your docs and find APIs quickly. You can use disclosure indicators to explore deeper in the tree.

If you know what you're looking for, use the Filter bar to find results in the navigator. Select tags.

## Optimize Content

Swift-DocC provides automatic organization. Organizes by type, like Articles, Tutorials, Protocols, Structures, etc. You can customize the ToC.

1. Define main high-level themes
2. Organize pages by importance and specificity. 
3. Optimize group titles.

### High-level themes

Decide the high-level topics - i.e. tasks/functionality - your framework covers. Create Topic Groups (categories), and decide what pages to include later.

Try to stick to under 10 topic groups per page.

Order of groups creates a good experience. 

### Organize pages by importance and specificity

Put the most important pages at the top of the navigator, like Essentials, Introductory articles, and Tutorials.

See the most important themes first, as you explore deeper in the tree, things get more specific.

### Optimize group titles

Titles should be clear and descriptive. i.e. "Management" is too general - "Care and Feeding" is clearer.

Topic group titles should be mutually exclusive. Otherwise, it can be hard to know if the topic group contains what you're looking for.
